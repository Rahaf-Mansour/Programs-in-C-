/*
Exercise 1:   Run the  program several times  using a different input  each time.
Does  the  program do what  you  expect?  Is so, explain what  it is doing. 
If not,  locate the  error  and  fix it.

Exercise 2:   Modify  the  program so that the  user  inputs both  
values to be tested for equality. Make  sure  you  have a prompt for each input. 
Test the program with  pairs  of values that are  the  same and  that are  different.

Exercise 3:   Modify  the  program so that when the  numbers are  the  same it prints 
the  following lines:
The values are the same. Hey that's a coincidence!

Exercise 4:   Modify  the  revised Exercise 3 program by replacing the  two  
if statements with  a single if/else statement. 
Run the  program again to test the  results.
